## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths (ROADMAP Success Criteria)

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Fresh-install AND upgrade load ~400 JP merchants, each categoryId resolving to a real L2 in default_categories.dart (seed-categoryId-is-real-L2 gate guards D-04) | ✓ VERIFIED | `default_merchants_categoryid_test.dart` is a full-list (no sampling) hard gate: every `DefaultMerchants.categoryId ∈ {Category where level==2}`. Ran host tests → all pass. 391 `DefaultMerchant(` entries across 10 split files (`~400` satisfied). Seed runs on fresh-install AND upgrade uniformly via the post-open count-guard in `SeedMerchantsUseCase` wired into `SeedAllUseCase` (real path: `main.dart:112`). |
| 2 | PRAGMA index_list returns non-empty on BOTH fresh-install and migrated DB; indexes built via explicit CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS in BOTH onCreate and onUpgrade (decorative customIndices trap avoided) | ✓ VERIFIED | `app_database.dart`: `_createMerchantIndexes()` issues 4 `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS` (match_key, merchant, region, category); called from `onCreate` (line 68) AND the `from < 22` `onUpgrade` block (line 479). `merchant_v22_migration_test.dart` asserts all 4 indexes on fresh-install + a `_runV22MigrationSteps` mirror of the upgrade path — host tests pass. The `customIndices` getters on both table classes are explicitly documented as DECORATIVE and not relied upon. |
| 3 | Re-running seed converges, not doubles — stable string ids + INSERT OR IGNORE + single-transaction batch; row count unchanged after restart | ✓ VERIFIED | `merchant_dao.dart`: `_db.transaction(() => _db.batch(... mode: InsertMode.insertOrIgnore))` — single transaction, INSERT OR IGNORE, Drift companions (no string interpolation). Stable authored `mer_<slug>` ids (never generated from JP name; enforced by id-prefix + dup test). `seed_merchants_use_case_test.dart` "idempotency — re-seed converges, row counts unchanged" passes; `SeedMerchantsUseCase` short-circuits when `findAll()` is non-empty. |
| 4 | Full migration ladder (v3→v22, v17→v22, v21→v22, fresh v22) verified on the encrypted SQLCipher executor path (not just NativeDatabase.memory()) | ✓ VERIFIED (on-device) | `integration_test/merchant_migration_ladder_test.dart` (284 lines, 7 testWidgets): asserts `PRAGMA cipher_version` non-empty, index_list non-empty, seed populated, every categoryId L2, re-seed convergence, across fresh-v22 + v21→v22 groups on `createEncryptedExecutor`. Deep-history v3/v17 covered by the host-VM ladder. **On-device run CONFIRMED 2026-06-23** — user ran the integration test on a booted iOS simulator/device and reported PASS (49-UAT.md Test 1). SQLCipher natives loaded (cipher_version non-empty); the documented 49-06 checkpoint:human-verify gate is now closed. |
| 5 | Schema includes region(JP) + multi-locale names + aliases + seed-time normalized match-key + L2 categoryId + non-authoritative ledger hint, 600-800 ceiling, reusable by regional expansion + MOD-005 OCR; names stored as Drift DATA, NOT ARB | ✓ VERIFIED | `merchants_table.dart`: id, nameJa(req), nameZh/nameEn(nullable), region(default 'JP'), categoryId, ledgerHint. `merchant_match_keys_table.dart`: surface, matchKey(indexed non-unique), kind. Domain `Merchant`/`MerchantMatchKey` mirror all dimensions. Aliases expand into match-key rows at seed time (`_surface(alias, 'alias')`). ARB leakage grep for merchant names → 0 hits (names are DATA). Schema docstrings cite the 600-800 ceiling + MERCH-V2-01 regional tail + MOD-005 OCR reuse. |

**Score:** 5/5 truths verified (Truth #4 closed on-device via UAT 2026-06-23)

### Required Artifacts

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status |
|------|-----|-----|--------|
| `SeedAllUseCase` | `SeedMerchantsUseCase` | constructor leaf, after categories, short-circuit | ✓ WIRED |
| `main.dart` | `SeedAllUseCase` | `ref.read(seedAllUseCaseProvider)` (real seed path, NOT seedRunner no-op) | ✓ WIRED |
| `SeedMerchantsUseCase` | `deriveLedgerHint` / `normalizeMerchantKey` | per-surface expansion | ✓ WIRED |
| `merchantRepository` provider | `MerchantDao` → `MerchantRepositoryImpl` | @riverpod, appDatabase | ✓ WIRED |
| `app_database` onCreate + onUpgrade | `_createMerchantIndexes()` | explicit calls both paths | ✓ WIRED |

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Source Plan | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|-------------|--------|----------|
| MERCH-01 | 49-03,04,05 | ✓ SATISFIED | merchants table + region/multi-locale/aliases/match-key/L2 categoryId/ledger hint; seed populates |
| MERCH-02 | 49-02,03 | ✓ SATISFIED | 391 JP merchants mapped to L2; normalizer (片↔平 fold, fullwidth/lowercase) authored + tested |
| MERCH-03 | 49-02 | ✓ SATISFIED (foundation) | Normalized match-key index built (the data底座 for anchored/normalized matching). Read-time scored matching is explicitly Phase 50 (this phase = data foundation, no consumer cutover) |
| MERCH-04 | 49-01,04,05,06 | ✓ SATISFIED | Idempotent seed + explicit indexes VERIFIED on host; "full ladder under encrypted executor" CONFIRMED on-device 2026-06-23 (Crit #4, 49-UAT.md Test 1 PASS) |
| MERCH-05 | 49-01,03 | ✓ SATISFIED | 600-800-ceiling schema, region, multi-locale DATA columns, OCR-reusable |

All 5 requirement IDs accounted for; no orphaned IDs.

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|---------|----------|--------|
| (none) | No TODO/FIXME/XXX/HACK/UnimplementedError in any phase-49 lib file | — | Clean |
| (none) | No merchant names in ARB (DATA discipline held) | — | Clean |

Advisory items from 49-REVIEW.md (0 blocker, 4 warning, 4 info) are non-blocking. Notable for follow-up:
- **WR-01** — `merchant_v22_migration_test.dart` re-implements the upgrade DDL (`_runV22MigrationSteps`) instead of driving the real `onUpgrade` migrator. The real encrypted onUpgrade is covered by the integration ladder (human-verify item #4). Host test proves the DDL contract, not the migrator invocation. Acceptable given the SQLCipher constraint; the integration test closes the gap on-device.
- **WR-02** — `deriveLedgerHint` parent-inheritance omits the `level==2` guard. Advisory; parity test currently passes for all 391 seeded categoryIds.

### Human Verification — RESOLVED 2026-06-23

**1. On-device encrypted migration ladder (Success Criterion #4 / MERCH-04 closure) — ✓ PASSED**

- **Test:** Boot an iOS simulator (or attach Android device), then run `flutter test integration_test/merchant_migration_ladder_test.dart`
- **Expected:** All 7 testWidgets pass; `PRAGMA cipher_version` NON-EMPTY; index_list non-empty on fresh-v22 AND v21→v22; ~391 rows seeded; every categoryId L2; re-seed counts unchanged.
- **Why human:** SQLCipher natives load only on a booted device. Host CI links plain libsqlite3 (masks cipher regressions). Documented blocking checkpoint in 49-06.
- **Result:** User ran the integration test on a booted iOS simulator/device on 2026-06-23 and reported PASS (49-UAT.md Test 1 = pass). Gate closed; phase 49 fully verified 5/5.

### Gaps Summary

No code gaps. The merchant directory is migrated from the 13-entry in-memory list to a persistent, indexed, idempotently re-seedable Drift `merchants` table with a normalized match-key index, multi-locale DATA columns, region tagging, and a derived non-authoritative ledger hint. 391 merchants seed via the real `SeedAllUseCase` path on both fresh-install and upgrade, behind a count-guard, in a single INSERT-OR-IGNORE transaction. All host-testable success criteria (#1, #2, #3, #5) are VERIFIED by passing tests. The single outstanding item (#4) is the on-device SQLCipher ladder RUN — a deliberate, documented human-verify checkpoint, not a code failure. "No behavior change, security first" holds: no existing MerchantDatabase consumer was cut over (cutover is Phase 50), and the encrypted executor path is the only seed/migration path.
