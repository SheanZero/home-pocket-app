<summary>✅ v1.2 Happiness Metric Refresh (Phases 13-17) — SHIPPED 2026-05-21</summary>

- [x] Phase 13: ADR-016 Backend Foundation (7/7 plans) — completed 2026-05-19

**Outcome:** v1.2 migrated the Joy metric from density (Joy/¥) to cumulative `Σ joy_contribution` (ADR-016): HomeHero rebuilt with sage-green→gold target ring, Settings exposes user-configurable `monthly_joy_target` with 3-month median recommendation + fallback baseline 50, AnalyticsScreen Variant ε retired density and added Custom Time Windows (week/month/quarter/year/arbitrary), Per-Category breakdown + Soul-vs-Survival comparison with anti-toxicity framing, and Manual-Only Joy sub-metric variant on Drift schema v17 (`entry_source` column). HomeHero isolation invariant (ADR-016 §3) structurally enforced. Audit status `tech_debt` accepted at close — Phase 13/17 lack VERIFICATION.md; 3 Nyquist VALIDATION.md drafts; documentation-grade debt only.

### 📋 Next Milestone (Planned)

Use `/gsd:new-milestone` to scope the next milestone. Candidate themes carried in PROJECT.md:

- **MOD-005 OCR module** — receipt scanning + parsing
- **Family privacy hardening (FAMILY-V2-01/02/03)** — strict consent gate, schema v17→v18 if needed
- **Release readiness QA (FUTURE-QA-01)** — owner-driven smoke tests before v1 public release
- **Tooling/docs cleanup (FUTURE-TOOL-03, FUTURE-DOC-*)** — coverage threshold review, ADR/MOD numbering drift
- **fl_chart 1.x upgrade (TOOL-V2-01)** — bundle with any future Analytics chart-stack work

Phase numbering continues from **Phase 18**.
