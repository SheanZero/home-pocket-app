<summary>✅ v1.1 Happiness Metric & Display (Phases 9-12) — SHIPPED 2026-05-05</summary>

**Outcome:** v1.1 delivered the happiness metric domain, integrated HomeHeroCard, Variant δ AnalyticsScreen, trilingual Joy/Daily ledger copy rename, and accepted ADR-015 lexical hierarchy. One Phase 11 human UAT verification item is acknowledged as deferred at close in `.planning/STATE.md`. Full details: `.planning/milestones/v1.1-ROADMAP.md`.

<summary>✅ v1.2 Happiness Metric Refresh (Phases 13-17) — SHIPPED 2026-05-21</summary>

- [x] Phase 13: ADR-016 Backend Foundation (7/7 plans) — completed 2026-05-19

**Outcome:** v1.2 migrated the Joy metric from density (Joy/¥) to cumulative `Σ joy_contribution` (ADR-016): HomeHero rebuilt with sage-green→gold target ring, Settings exposes user-configurable `monthly_joy_target` with 3-month median recommendation + fallback baseline 50, AnalyticsScreen Variant ε retired density and added Custom Time Windows (week/month/quarter/year/arbitrary), Per-Category breakdown + Soul-vs-Survival comparison with anti-toxicity framing, and Manual-Only Joy sub-metric variant on Drift schema v17 (`entry_source` column). HomeHero isolation invariant (ADR-016 §3) structurally enforced. Audit status `tech_debt` accepted at close — Phase 13/17 lack VERIFICATION.md; 3 Nyquist VALIDATION.md drafts; documentation-grade debt only.

**Outcome:** v1.3 transformed ledger entry into single-screen, voice-trustworthy core experience. Single shared `TransactionDetailsForm` widget powers 4 hosts (manual, voice, edit, OCR review). `ManualOneStepScreen` collapses 2-screen entry chain; SmartKeyboard 48dp non-negotiable touch-target floor with 6 golden baselines. Locale-aware zh+ja voice number parsing (state machines + `VoiceChunkMerger` 2.5s continued-listening window) at zh 96% + ja 100% corpus accuracy. `VoiceCategoryResolver` always-L2 contract with merchant DB + extensible synonym dictionary. Hold-to-record gesture with AnimatedContainer shape morph + caption swap (`<100ms` verified). 2 BLOCKER gaps (G-01/G-02) elevated and closed in Phase 22. Phase 23 cleanup absorbed carried tech-debt: scanner allow-lists, 6 voice-flow surgical fixes, 4 mechanical polish items, REQUIREMENTS.md reconciliation, 9/9 device UATs passed, `voice_input_screen.dart` slimmed 838→776 LOC via mixin + helpers extraction. Audit status `tech_debt` accepted at close — documentation-grade Nyquist debt only; all 15 v1.3 requirements satisfied and reconciled.

### 📋 Next Milestone (Planned)

Use `/gsd:new-milestone` to scope. Candidate themes carried in PROJECT.md:

- **MOD-005 OCR writer landing** — receipt → text → fields (v1.3 reserved architectural slot in `OcrReviewScreen` with MOD-005 marker; schema accepts 'ocr' literal already)
- **VOICE-POLISH-V2** — consolidate Phase 22 advisory WR-02/03/06/07/NEW-02/NEW-03 + IN-01/02/03 + Phase 23 WR-06 into a focused polish phase
- **VOICE-EN-V2-01** — English voice parser (skeleton only in Plan 23-03)
- **Family privacy hardening (FAMILY-V2-01/02/03)** — strict consent gate, schema v17→v18 if needed
- **Release readiness QA (FUTURE-QA-01)** — owner-driven smoke tests before v1 release
- **Tooling/docs cleanup (FUTURE-TOOL-03, FUTURE-DOC-*)** — coverage threshold review, ADR/MOD numbering drift
- **fl_chart 1.x upgrade (TOOL-V2-01)** — bundle with any future Analytics chart-stack work
